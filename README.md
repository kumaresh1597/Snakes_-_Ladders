# Snakes_-_Ladders
Implemented a Snake and Ladder game using JavaFX, allowing users to play a classic board game on their computer.
Created a Board class to represent the game board, with 100 squares and snakes/ladders at specified positions.
Developed a Player class to represent the players as coins and track their current position on the board.
Populated snakes and Ladders with the starting and ending positions of each snake and ladder on the board.
Allowed players to move based on their current position on the board and the outcome of random dice value.
